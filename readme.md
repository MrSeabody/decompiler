# Decompiler
## A Sims 4 Modding Utility

Decompiler is a collection of scripts optimised to help create an environment for modding The Sims 4.

It is currently in a basic state, but will be expanded in future.

## Usage (The Seven Step Routine)
1. Install Python (the 3.3 series is currently supported) and add python to your PATH environment variable (or just make sure that the option to do so is ticked in the Windows Installer)
2. Download the latest release.
3. Extract into your development folder. *This must be done in a dedicated folder or bad things will happen!*
4. Run decompile.bat.
5. Extract the .zip files into folders.
6. Run decompile.bat again. It will likely take a while. It is also likely that you'll see errors -- don't worry! That's normal.
7. You are done, you can start modding! :-)
